Now that you know the basics of C#, try to write programs to solve the following:

1. Find the sum of this convergent series by considering the first 10 terms: 1 + 2/7 + 3/72 + 4/73 + ...

2. What's the difference between int and Int32? What would happen if you assign an int value to an Int16 data type? Write a program to show these differences.

3. Given a string "ABCD", print the following:
   A
  AB
 ABC
ABCD

4. Create an array or a List with these words: "Hindi", "English", "Kannada", "Urdu", "Punjabi", "Tamil". Then output the number of vowels present in each word.

5. Create the following:
int[] a = {1, 2, 3, 4};
string[] b = {"st", "nd", "th", "th"};
Combine them to obtain a new array that has {"1st", "2nd", "3th", "4th"}

6. Print the following string to console and explain the output: "c:\new\top.txt"

7. A palindrome is a word that reads the same backwards and forwards. For example, "malayalam" and "madam" are palindromes. Given a string, write code to check if it's a palindrome.

8. Given epoch time and a specific timezone, write a program to output a more readable date time value in both UTC and the specified timezone. For example, with inputs 1666000000 and +05:30, output could be 2022-10-17 09:46:40 UTC and  2022-10-17 15:16:40 +05:30.

9. A bag has thirty fruits of three types: oranges, guavas and apples. Each orange weighs 75 grams. Each guava weighs 88 grams. Each apple weighs 107 grams. The total weight of all thirty fruits is 3000 grams. Write a program to find how many oranges, guavas and apples are there in the bag.

10. Download the following CSV file: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/curran/a08a1080b88344b0c8a7/raw/0e7a9b0a5d22642a06d3d5b9bcbad9890c8ee534/iris.csv
The file includes flowers of three species: setosa, versicolor and virginica. Write a program to read the file and count the number of flowers of each species, the minimum/maximum/mean of sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. Output these results as a neat table.

11. Solve the Excercise10 using **SQL** , **LINQ**, **Entity Framework** and **MySQL**. After that Testing is done by **Specflow**.
12. **Asynchronous Programming** Example from Microsoft docs.
13. **Asynchronous Programming** Examples from Microsoft docs.
